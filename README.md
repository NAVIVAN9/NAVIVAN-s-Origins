# NAVIVAN-s-Origins

Impact determining method (inspired by the SCP wiki's box test)

Low: If you choose an origin and you can still play the normal minecraft experience, then it's probably low (Interdimensional Traveler)

Medium: If you choose an orign and you have to make certain changes to take advantage of its strengths and weaknesses, then it's probably medium (silverkin)

High: If you choose an origin, and you have to completely change the way you play, then it's probably high (stranger)

The Interdimensional traveler can switch dimensions, but you don't have to use any of it's abilities, so it's low
The silverkin is small and the phasing is optional, so you don't have to make any changes to your playstyle except for getting used to your height and playing a little more carefully due to the decreased health, so it's medium
The Stranger removes the top layer of blocks and only lets you intermittently see mobs, thus requiring you to completely change how you encounter each scenario, so it's high
